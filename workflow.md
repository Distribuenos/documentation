# Workflow
We use Trello as our primary source to keep track of our work distribution.
 
## New issue
When adding a new issue, first create a Trello card for it according to the templates provided in this documentation repository. When working on the Trello card create an issue in the according repository. The issue can be a less descriptive version of the Trello card but it still has to be descriptive enough to identify the according Trello card.
 
## Branches
- The master branch represents the product (working branch)
- One develop branch for each sprint, merged out from master
- At the end of each sprint the develop branch should be merged to master
- Create a feature branch based on the current develop branch for each new feature or bug
 
## Commits
In you commits reference the GitLab Issue ID (#XY) and give a short description of the work done
 
## Merge requests
Use the issue template for merge requests and reference the corresponding issues in it.
